## 🚀 About Me

I'm a software engineer with a strong focus on **system design and cloud architecture**.

Rather than only implementing features, I focus on:
- defining **clear assumptions and requirements**
- making **explicit architectural trade-offs**
- validating designs through **implementation and benchmarking**

I have hands-on experience designing and verifying systems involving:
**distributed systems, caching strategies, ID generation, MLOps pipelines, and high-traffic architectures**.

Currently, I'm seeking roles where I can contribute as a  
**Cloud Engineer / Backend Engineer / System Design-oriented Engineer**.

---

## 🧠 My Engineering Focus

- **System Design & Architecture**
  - Scalability, availability, cost optimization
  - Trade-offs between simplicity and resilience

- **Distributed Systems**
  - ID generation strategies (Snowflake, Ticket Server)
  - Cache layers, eventual consistency, failure handling

- **Cloud & MLOps**
  - AWS-centric architecture (multi-cloud aware)
  - ML training, evaluation, deployment pipelines

## 🌟 Featured Work (Start Here)

These repositories represent my **design thinking and practical verification**:

- 🔹 **practice_infra_arch**  
  A collection of real-world inspired infrastructure and system design exercises  
  (Cloud architecture, caching, distributed ID, MLOps)

- 🔹 **Search Autocomplete System**  
  Low-latency (<200ms P95), cost-constrained system design with multi-layer caching

- 🔹 **Distributed ID Generation Design**  
  Design and implementation comparison of ID generation strategies in distributed systems

👉 See pinned repositories below for detailed designs and trade-off discussions.
